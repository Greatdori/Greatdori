name: ðŸ’¥ Report a crash in library

      label: Description
      description: >
        A concise description of what causes the problem, in human language.
        Though not required, it may help us to more accurately triage the issue
        as well as understand a non-trivial test case.

    attributes:
      label: Reproduction
      description: >
        Provide a test case, preferably in a Markdown code block, and explain
        how to build or run it to reproduce the problem. Consider reducing the
        test case to the smallest amount of code possible â€” a smaller test case
        is easier to reason about and more appealing to contributors.
