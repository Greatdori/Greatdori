## Building
Xcode 26.0 and Swift 6.2+ is required for building this project.

CMake is required for building from Xcode Project,
you can install it by Homebrew if you don't have one:

```sh
brew install cmake
```

First, create a directory for the Greatdori! project:

```sh
mkdir Greatdori
cd Greatdori
```

Then clone this project by Git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Greatdori/Greatdori.git
cd Greatdori
```

Note that there should be two `Greatdori` folders,
your current path like this:

```sh
$ pwd
/path/to/Greatdori/Greatdori
```

Use the `utils/update-checkout` script to checkout all repositories
that Greatdori! needs. Add `--clone` option for the first time
to clone all repositories:

```sh
utils/update-checkout --clone
```

After cloning all repositories needed, use `utils/generate-workspace`
to generate a `xcworkspace` for building project:

```sh
utils/generate-workspace
```

Open `Greatdori.xcworkspace`, then select a scheme you want to build.

### Schemes
There're several schemes in Greatdori! project:

- **Greatdori**: The Greatdori! app for iOS, iPadOS and macOS;
- **Greatdori Widgets**: Widget extension for **Greatdori** scheme;
- **Greatdori Watch App**: The Greatdori! app for watchOS;
- **Greatdori Watch Widgets**: Widget extension for **Greatdori Watch App** scheme;
- **BuiltinCardCollections**: Built-in card collection for widgets;
- **Greatdori Installer**: Generates a `pkg` installer for macOS app;
- **CardCollectionGen**: A CLI tool which generates built-in card collections;
- **GreatLyrics**: A tool for making lyrics file of songs.

Besides, some targets have a corresponding *Without Pre-Cache* scheme,
which builds the target without [pre-cache](#pre-cache) for DoriKit.

### Pre-Cache
To make it faster to get some data which is updated less frequent,
DoriKit generates a `PreCache.cache` file in **compile-time**
and embeds it to `DoriKit.framework` bundle. This allows you to get some information
like character list from `DoriCache.preCache` without performing a network request.

Pre-Cache generation happens when you first build DoriKit for a configuration,
after you cleaned build folder, or if the previous generation date was over a week ago.
If you're experiencing a poor network connection
that makes you can't generate pre-cache successfully,
you can opt-out it by building your target from `Without Pre-Cache` scheme.

### Code Signing
All development teams of each targets are set to `Yuxuan Chen (8CZ4JT4F3M)`
which makes it easier for our CI runs and distribution workflows.
You have to change it to your own team before building,
or choose *None* if you build it only for simulator or macOS.
(And don't forget to change it back if you'd like to open a pull request!)
