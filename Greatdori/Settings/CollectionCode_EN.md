# About Collection Code

Collection Code is a string that contains collection informations, allow users to quickly export and share collections to others.

Every Collection Code contains version specifier and verification code, aiming to check code version and validity, avoiding errors caused by data doctoring.

Collection Code's generator is developed by Greatdori! Developers. The current algorithm version is *Timbre*.

## Timbre

Code generated by Timbre is composed from 94 ASCII characters. It will contains all card Ids in the collection and the title of it. You can prevent the code from including title by enabling Share Without Title.

Timbre is completely anonymous, it will not contain any data other than card IDs and collection title. The unique card combination and title will generate a unique code. Timbre is also offline, which means it works even when offline. Timbre can be shared to everyone safely as an archive.

(Note: Importing collection requires internet collection in order to fetch card cover image. Thus you might not import collections from Greatdori! offline.)
